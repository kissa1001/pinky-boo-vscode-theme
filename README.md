A light theme with a bit touch of soft pink colors. Happy coding ‚ù§Ô∏è

I use [Oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) with [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) to achieve the view below, if you want to do the same setup, make sure you follow [this](https://gist.github.com/480/3b41f449686a089f34edb45d00672f28) instruction to install the correct font for icons.
